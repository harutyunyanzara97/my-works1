                  <p>Processing is necessary to perform the contract governing our provision of our Service or to take steps that you request
                  prior to signing up for the Service. If we have not entered into a contract with you, we process your personal
                  information based on our legitimate interest in providing the Service you access and request.</p>
                  <p>These activities constitute our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal information for these activities where
                  our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to
                  by law).</p>
                  <p>Processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
                  <p>Processing is based on your consent. Where we rely on your consent, you have the right to withdraw it any time in the
                  manner indicated when you consent or in the Service.</p>

            <h3 class="privace__block-item-info">Use For New Purposes.</h3>
            <p>We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the
            reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we need to use your personal information for an
            unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.</p>
            <h3 class="privace__block-item-info">Retention</h3>
            <p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, including for
            the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for
            fraud prevention purposes.
            To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity
            of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal
            information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes
            through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
            When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it
            or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If
            we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information
            indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
            <h3 class="privace__block-item-info">Your Rights</h3>
            <p>If you are located in the EEA, you have the following rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you:</p>

                  (along with certain details). If you require additional copies, we may need to charge a reasonable fee. Right to
                  rectification: If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to request to
                  have it rectified. Right to erasure: You can ask us to delete or remove your personal information in some circumstances
