                              not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights granted hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without
                              Ennerx’s prior written consent, and any attempt by you to do so, without such consent, will be void. Ennerx may freely

                              in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this Agreement will be without prejudice to
